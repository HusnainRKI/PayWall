== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Is content really secure from leakage? =

Yes. Locked content is filtered server-side and never sent to the browser for unauthorized users. This includes HTML source, REST API responses, RSS feeds, and meta tags.

= Can I use this with caching plugins? =

Absolutely. The plugin is designed to work with popular caching solutions. Teaser content is cacheable, while unlocked content sets appropriate private cache headers.

= What happens to guest purchases when users register? =

When a guest user creates an account with the same email address, their purchases are automatically transferred to their user account.

= Can I customize the paywall appearance? =

Yes. The plugin provides filters for customizing placeholder HTML, unlock buttons, and teaser content. CSS classes are also provided for styling.

= Does this work with headless WordPress? =

Yes. The plugin provides full REST API endpoints for headless implementations while maintaining server-side security.

= Are there any content restrictions? =

The plugin respects WordPress content policies. All content rules that apply to your WordPress site apply to premium content as well.
